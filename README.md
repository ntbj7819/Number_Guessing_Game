### 1. **Imports:**
   The code starts by importing two tools:
   - `random`: This tool is used to pick a random number for the user to guess.
   - `statistics`: This tool helps us calculate the average, middle value, and most common number from all the guesses.

### 2. **start_game() Function:**
   This function controls the main part of the game.

   - **Starting the game:**
     The game welcomes the player and then chooses a random number between 1 and 50 that the player needs to guess.

   - **Guessing Loop:**
     The game keeps asking the player to guess a number. The player can enter any number between 1 and 50:
     - If the player enters a number that’s not between 1 and 50, the game asks them to try again.
     - If the player doesn’t enter a valid number (like a letter or symbol), the game asks them to enter a number again.

   - **Checking the guess:**
     - If the guess is too high, the game says "It's lower."
     - If the guess is too low, the game says "It's higher."
     - If the guess is correct, the game says "You guessed correctly!" and stops asking for more guesses.

   - **Statistics:**
     After the player guesses the right number, the game shows:
     - How many guesses it took to get the right answer.
     - The **mean** (average) of all the guesses.
     - The **median** (middle guess when all guesses are ordered).
     - The **mode** (the most common guess). If there is no guess that repeats, it will say "No single mode."

### 3. **replay() Function:**
   After finishing the game, the program asks the player if they want to play again:
   - If the player says "Y", it starts a new game.
   - If the player says "N", it says "Goodbye!" and ends the game.
   - If the player enters something other than "Y" or "N", it asks again for a correct answer.

### 4. **Starting the Game:**
   At the end of the code, the game starts by calling the `start_game()` function. Once the game is over, the `replay()` function is called to see if the player wants to play again.

### Issues:
- The code uses some extra backslashes (`\`) by mistake in the print statements, which should be removed.
- There might be an issue if the game restarts multiple times and doesn't stop properly because the `replay()` function calls `start_game()` again.

### In short:
- The game picks a random number between 1 and 50.
- The player tries to guess the number, and the game gives hints if the guess is too high or too low.
- When the player guesses correctly, it shows how many tries it took and gives some statistics about the guesses.
- Then, the player can choose to play again or quit.
